# Dissertation-Python
The code within the file 'Python Codes' folder was all of the code used for this dissertation. 
Some of the code was used for multiple areas of the project. For instance, I adjusted the 'TL227 kNN Dissertation.py' file to perform analysis for each subset. The same goes for 'TL227SVMAnalysis.py'. 
The Genius API stores the Lyrics data. To be able to use this you need an API key. I don't think I can share this so I have left it out. The API is pretty intuative and there are instructions for how to use it at https://docs.genius.com .
Excel files for storing the results are also attached. I'm not sure if they can be opened on github, but they can be downloaded from here. 
Alot of the code requires the downloading of libraries, I downloaded these directly to my computer via the Terminal, so in order to run the code the libraries will have to be downloaded.
